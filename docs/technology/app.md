# App

### App technology

There is a single codebase for the app to be run either as a native app in Android, iOS devices, Windows computers or as a web app from the browser. The app is written in TypeScript using the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) framework and [Vue.js.](https://vuejs.org)

### PWA

The app is currently shipped as a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps) (PWA) with the main instance at [https://komunitin.org](https://komunitin.org). Users need to visit the site and optionally install it to their device as an application. Nothing prevents this app to be bundled and shipped through the Google and Apple application stores, but currently the PWA model allows for quicker and easier development and release cycle.

### Material Design

The user experience and design of the app has been designed to follow the Google's [Material Design](https://material.io/) guidelines.
