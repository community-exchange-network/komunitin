In this server there are two groups "NET1" and "NET2" with some users in each. You can use any of the following credentials to log in:

**NET1 - regular user**\
email: euclides@komunitin.org\
password: komunitin

**NET1 - admin user**\
email: riemann@komunitin.org\
password: komunitin

**NET2 - regular user**\
email: noether@komunitin.org\
password: koumunitin

The demo instance is automatically deployed with the lastest code in the main branch. It may occasionally be down or corrupted due to maintenance, testing or users changing passwords and/or config settings from the admin user. It is regularly reset with fresh data.
