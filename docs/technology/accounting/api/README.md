# API

The Komunitin Accounting API defines a protocol to make transfers and transfer requests between members of exchange communities. It is a HTTP REST JSON api following the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org) specification.

It can be used for simple transfers between members of the same exchange community but can also be used to make external transfers between members of different exchange communities automatically following a path of one or more currency exchange steps. The api has methods for creating and managing currencies, accounts, etc.

There is an OpenAPI spec file automatically generated from the test suite [here](../../../../accounting/openapi/openapi\_v3.json). You can browse it using Swagger:
