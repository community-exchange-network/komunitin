# Notifications

The platform may deliver messages to users using three different channels: email, push notifications and in-app notifications. Users can configure their notification preferences and enable or disable different kinds of notifications.

## Email
Email messages are divided into two categories: *My account* and *Community news*.

### My account
These emails are tied to events that affect a user directly and that are important to keep a record of. Typical examples include:

- Transfers: sent, received, pending, rejected.
- Offers/needs lifecycle: about to expire, expired.
- Account status changes: disabled, suspended, re-activated.
- Security-related messages: password reset/renewal, sign-in or device changes (when applicable).

Users can enable/disable *My account* emails from their notification settings. We highly recommend keeping them enabled, since they act as an audit trail for key account actions and security events.

### Community news
These emails are a periodic newsletter designed to help users keep up with the community without receiving a message for every single event. They include:

- A selection of recent offers/needs.
- A short account summary (e.g. balance and recent activity highlights).
- Community-level statistics and news.

Users can configure the frequency of *Community news* emails (weekly or monthly) or disable them entirely.

## Push Notifications
Push notifications are short messages sent to users' devices to inform them about important events or updates. Users need to provide explicit consent to receive push notifications and they can manage their preferences in the app settings. We also divide push notifications into the same two categories *My account* and *Community news*. Users can choose to enable or disable each category independently.

Most push notifications respect the quiet hours and will only be sent from 8AM to 10PM in the local user timezone.

### My account
These notifications inform users about important events related to their account, and are intended to be timely and actionable. Including:

- Transfers: sent, received, pending, rejected.
- Offers/needs: about to expire, expired.
- Account status changes: disabled, suspended, activated.
- Occasional account “health” nudges (e.g. no active offers/needs).

Users can enable/disable *My account* push notifications from their notification settings. We highly recommend keeping them enabled to stay informed about critical account activities.

### Community news
These notifications inform users about community-related updates, such as:

- New members joining the community.
- New offers published.
- New needs published.

To avoid overwhelming users, new offers/needs are treated differently depending on urgency:

- **Urgent**: offers/needs expiring within 7 days. These generate push notifications immediately when published.
- **Normal**: everything else. These are batched and sent only occasionally as a digest.

Users can enable/disable *Community news* push notifications independently from *My account* notifications.

### Devices

If a user has several devices, they will get the push notifications to all their devices. Note that users will stop receiving push notifications in a device after a few months of not opening the app from this device.

## In-app Notifications
In-app notifications are messages displayed within the app interface itself. They are equivalent to push notifications but are only visible from the app. Users can't disable in-app notifications since they are not intrusive and are only visible when the user is actively using the app.

Users can see their history of notifications in a dedicated page of the app, where they can review past messages and take any necessary actions.
