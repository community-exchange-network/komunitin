## Communities

Communities are the social counterparty of currencies as each community is related one-to-one with a currency. A community has a logo, a name, a description, a location, some means of contact, their membership terms, etc. Only the community administrator can update these details.

All other resources (members, offers and needs etc) belong to a single community.

## Members

A member is the subject in Komunitin and belongs to a single community. A member has a profile picture, a name, a description, a location, some means of contact and a community currency account. One member has only one account in one currency. If a person must have more than one account (for example a business account and a personal one), then they will manage two members too.

Anybody can sign up to be a community member, but the administration needs to manually accept each application. Before the sign up process, members must accept the community membership terms.

## Offers and needs

Every member can publish offers and needs. An offer is basically a post with several pictures, a title, a description, a value in community currency (that can be left to any text like "request quote" or "8¢/kg") and an expiry date.

A need is formally like similar to an offer, but while offers usually last months or years, needs are supposed to expire in few days. They don't have title and the piscure is not so important.

#### Categories

Offers and needs belong to a category. Example of categories are "Food", "Healthcare", "Professional services", "Construction", etc. Categories can be customized for each community depending on concrete needs.
