# Overview

Komunitin is an app featuring a **local community currency wallet** and a **marketplace** allowing these local communities to easily trade between themselves and other communities. It effectively facilitates trade between a **decentralized set of local community currencies**.

Community currencies, also referred to as [local currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local\_currency) or local exchange trade systems ([LETS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local\_exchange\_trading\_system)), are a tool for financial inclusion that allows for a transition to a fairer and more ecologically sustainable economy.
