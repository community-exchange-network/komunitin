# Terminology Guidelines 

We use consistent terminology across the app to ensure clarity and alignment with our values. Our word choices aim to:

1.  **Be intuitive** - Easy for users to understand
2.  **Avoid financial jargon** - No "money", "payment", "pay", "payer", "payee"
3.  **Use “send tokens” metaphor** - Frame interactions as sending/receiving, but without using the word "token"
