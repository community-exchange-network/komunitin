# New currency

To open a new local currency on komunitin.org, please read carefully and follow the instructions below.

## Do you really want to open a new group?

If you want to create an account in an existing group, go to [komunitn.org](https://komunitin.org) and find your local group.

If you are evaluating the system please use the [Demo Site](../overview/demo.md). Please do not create a new group just to test it, as this creates management work for us and uses up resources.

Please read the [Terms of Use](terms-of-use.md) and be sure you're comfortable with them.

Creating a community currency exchange network that is truly useful is a task that requires a lot of dedication and effort. There are many cases of networks that start without a sufficiently motivated group to drive them and end up failing. So before taking the step and opening the group, it is important to carefully consider the objectives and characteristics of the currency, how you will spread the idea, how you will manage incidents, and to research how similar experiences to yours work... Once everything is ready, go ahead!

## Import data

If your network is already running on another system, maybe we can automatically import all the data without losing the history. In this case, do not fill out the form but instead [contact us](contact.md) directly, and we will check the best way to do it.

## Apply

To register a new group in the system, you need to fill out a form. Pay special attention to the Code field (four uppercase letters), which will be the identifier of your network and the four letters that all account numbers will start with. Choose carefully the name of the currency and the symbol as well.&#x20;

After the group is approved you'll access the administrative interface and you'll be able to tune the settings.
