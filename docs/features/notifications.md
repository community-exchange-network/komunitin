# Notifications

The app sends notifications to members using two channels: email and push notifications. Users can configure their notification preferences and enable/disable different kind of notifications.

#### My account

Each time a relevant even happens related to a user's account, an email and/or a push notification (depending on their preferences) is sent to the user. From the accounting features, this includes new received payments, new committed payment requests (if set to accept them automatically) and approval or rejection of payment requests. From the social features, this includes the expiration of a user's offer or need.

#### Members, offers, needs

Additionally, a push notification may be sent every time a new member joins the community, a new offer is published or a new need is published.

#### Devices

If a user has several devices, they will get the push notifications to all their devices. Note that users will stop receiving push notifications in a device after a month of not opening the app from this device.
