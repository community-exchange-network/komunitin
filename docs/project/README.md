# Project

### Purpose

Komunitin aims to be the leading open source project for community currency exchanges by providing an engaging and decentralized, yet reliable application they can all use.

### Offer

As a community currency administrator you can use Komunitin in two ways:

* From the common instance at komunitin.org. Just fill a form to create your own currency, wait for it to be accepted and you can start configuring the details of your currency and onboarding new members. You need to accept the [terms of use](terms-of-use.md) and make a small contribution to the system maintenance.
* Deploy your own instance. All the software in komunitin project is open source and ready to be deployed in your own server, provided you have the required infrastructure and technical skills.

### Contribution

This project is open to contributions. Just fork the code and open a Pull Request in the project [Github](https://github.com/komunitin/komunitin). We are also welcome bug reports and are open to feature requests at the Github issue queue, but our time to answer all questions is limited.

### Paid services

Need some new feature, a custom design and/or domain but don't want to do it by yourself? We can customize a komunitin app for you. Need some further professional support? Contact us for a quote.

### Roadmap

Komunitin and its predecessor IntegralCES has been developed and supported by the community for more than 10 years. We have a concrete roadmap but we don't have concrete deadlines, as the speed of development depends on available funding and voluntary work.

The team is doing an epic effort to convert our old centralized system to a modern, engaging, easy to use, secure and decentralized app.

The four main stages of the development roadmap match the four components of the whole Komunitin system:

1. Komunitin app
2. Notifications service
3. Accounting service
4. Social service

At this moment we have published and working versions for the Komunitin app and the Notifications service at [komunitin.org](http://komunitin.org) and we're actively developing the Accounting service using the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) blockchain.

After that, we'll upgrade the social service (offers, needs, profiles, locations, governance). The goal will be to create or integrate a federated/decentralized marketplace (and other social features) for community currencies.

### Stellar award

This project has received the **Activation award** from the **Stellar Development Foundation** :tada:. This award allowed the development team to fund the development of the 3rd point: the Accounting Service and completely replace the old interface by the new app. Thanks Stellar!
